<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<h4><em>"Creative health nut turned curious developer eager to inspire and change the world one line of code at a time."</em></h4>
<h3>Why coding?</h3>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2014 with a degree in Health &amp; Human Physiology. Up until this point, I was mainly interested in nutrition/food and the exercise/sport sciences. I spent my summers camp counseling kids on overnight trips around the Midwest for an outdoor adventure camp. These summers were epic so I've included a page to share some of the fun. Unsure of how to utilize this degree, my plan after college became to work my way up in these fields of interest. I spent time in numerous restaurant settings and taking personal training classes. Disillusioned from the lack of upward mobility, I looked for change and happened upon The Creative Circus of Atlanta, GA. A summer of a new city, warm weather, access to all new people and a creative bootcamp was an incredible experience. It awoke me to two things: 1) Interactive Development or coding. 2) Not to be afraid of putting my ideas out there. The second was more of a seed that has just begun to grow and allowed me to overcome my writer's block. For this, I will always love the friends I made, the staff that put up with me, and the city of Atlanta. I hope to return to someday. After</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	<p>Two of my greatest inspirations are Robin Williams and Steve Jobs. Their compassion and drive to live their life to the fullest while desperately trying to leave the world a better place than they found it.</p>
