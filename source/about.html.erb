	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
	<p>I'm a down to earth, fun loving, and hardworking type of guy who's bright, energetic, and almost always the happiest guy in the room. I'm a curious problem solver, eager to be constantly exploring new ways to look at the bigger picture. I pride myself on having a high emotional intelligence and using that to help others. All in all, I'm a jack of all trades who will never stop chasing my best self. </p>
	<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	<p>Losing over 120 pounds and keeping it off. What an incredible difference it's made in my life! I hope some of my work will help enable others acheive the same results and happiness.</p>
	<h3>Why coding?</h3>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2014 with a degree in Health &amp; Human Physiology. Up until this point, I was mainly interested in nutrition/food and the exercise/sport sciences. I spent two summers as a camp counselor accompanying kids on overnight trips around the Midwest. For an outdoor adventure camp, these summers were epic so I've included a page to share some of the fun. Unsure of how to utilize this degree, my plan after college was to work my way up in these fields of interest. I spent time in numerous restaurant settings while taking personal training classes. Nothing stuck. Disillusioned, I knew I needed a change. That's when I found <em>The Creative Circus</em> in Atlanta, GA. </p>
	<p>My summer in Atlanta was an incredible experience. It explosed me to the field of Interactive Development, and taught me to not to be afraid of putting my ideas out there. I learned to become very comfortable being uncomfortable - essential in the field of programming, as I'm finding out. The lessons I learned in Atlanta were crucial for me to sign up for and be successful at Dev Bootcamp. </p>
