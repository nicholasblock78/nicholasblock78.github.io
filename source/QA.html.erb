			<h3>Who are your biggest role models?</h3>
			<p>My two role models are Steve Jobs and Robin Williams. These two men are a few of the most influential in the history of our country, even the world. I’ve spent my life trying to find the balance between their eccentric personalities – a perfect mix between Steve’s “go get ‘em” leadership with Robin’s humor and compassion.</p>
