I decided to leverage the Middleman framework to build my website as I had no need for a database and only needed to serve some static web pages. They have some really neat features that helped organize my code and made building my site much more enjoyable. ([Check them out here!](https://middlemanapp.com/)).

The site is using still using the default erb for my preprocessed HTML, but I'm hoping to pick up Pug (aka Jade) to eventually replace erb. 

Hope you enjoy! :happy:

If you have any ideas on how to help make my site better, please drop me a line! I always appreciate any and all advice. Thanks!
